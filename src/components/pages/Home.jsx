                    When I was a child, our family gatherings would often bring together 50 to 100 people. I would always feel a bit
                    lost and constantly ask my parents, "Who is this person?" They would patiently explain, "This is a relative from this
                    branch of the family; he’s your third cousin or great-uncle." Those moments sparked my curiosity about our family
                    connections.

                    Now, with modern technology at our fingertips, I decided to create a website where you can effortlessly add family
                    members and clearly see how everyone is connected. This way, we can preserve our family ties and make it
                    easier for future generations to understand their roots.

                    This website was created to preserve the heritage of our ancestors for future generations. I want my children to
                    know their roots, honor family traditions, and understand their family connections.
